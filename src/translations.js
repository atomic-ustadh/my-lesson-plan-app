        aboutMissionContent: "In today's fast-paced educational environment, teachers need tools that are not just powerful, but also intuitive, flexible, and culturally aware. Our mission is to empower educators, particularly in Islamic schools, with a modern lesson planning application that respects and integrates the unique bilingual needs of English and Arabic curricula. We aim to streamline the planning process, giving teachers more time to focus on what they do best: inspiring and educating students.",
        aboutStoryTitle: "The Story Behind the App",
        aboutStoryContent: "This application was born from a simple observation: a lack of high-quality, bilingual educational tools designed with the specific workflows of Islamic schools in mind. Seeing this gap, we were motivated to create a solution that was more than just a text editor—a comprehensive platform that handles right-to-left language support seamlessly and understands the structure of a well-defined lesson plan.",
